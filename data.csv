In this argument my friends are all against me so Im wondering if Im exaggerating my feelings  I feel   Im being attacked and that is making me blow things out of proport and taking the role of the victim  when in reality Im the one being unreasonable and I am simply annoying my reasonable friends  Or are they   being insensitive and not respecting me in our friendship,0

Ive tried working out and eating fruits and vegetables  but I always seem to eat the junk in the house ,0
Vacuous  It     a lack of interest in anything  even things   taking care of yourself and eating  Activities that were once enjoyable hold no meaning whatsoever ,1
Extreme loneliness  ness  possibly anger  boredom  and a crushing feeling that nothing is going to improve in your life ,1
Despite its colloquial usage   rarely has a central identifiable cause (I got  after my   broke up with me) that can be fixed to solve the problem  Its usually the culminat of years of things going wrong  with one particular incident  perhaps  breaking the camels back ,1
Not caring if my friends dont call me anymore  not wanting to get up  not wanting to go out  not having the energy to do anything at all   take a shower or dress or eat  Giving up everything to do nothing and then play tetris for eight hours straight so I dont have to think about it ,1
The lack of feeling ,1
When I started to take meds and they started working  I remember being  because my friend couldnt go with me somewhere  Then I almost cried with joy because I actually FELT SOMETHING ,1
Id tell you  but I dont have the motivat or creativity to explain it very well right now   ,1
 (for me  at least YMMV) is sort of   waiting for something that you know is never going to happen  but you cant help but wait anyways  and while youre waiting for this indeterminable event to occur you cant do anything else ,1
This arises from a confluence of things  First and foremost  theres the anhedonia  in which you cant derive pleasure from anything  even activities that you love or situats that are beneficial  Note I didnt say you cant recognize the good in things you can see things for how good they are  but you cant FEEL how good they are ,1
Next  and this is the worst for me  is the lack of motivat and energy  Im not talking about not wanting to do things  though this is far more intense  This is a complete inability to perform even the most basic of tasks (going to work/school  shopping for food  hell  even bathing) simply because you cant bring yourself to do it  These are things you know you should be doing  and youll sit there  thinking about how you need to do them  but you   wont do it  Not because you dont want to  but because you cant  You   dont have the energy  and no amount of persuas is going to change that  This part seems the hardest for people without  to grasp you cant simply talk someone out of astate ,1
Then theres the listlessness  Oh god  the listlessness  If you dont know what I mean by that    combine the two previous points Imagine you can rarely bring yourself to accomplish anything  and when you do  it     an empty victory (or more appropriately  it doesnt feel   anything at all)  Add those two factors together  and then imagine what the time in between activities must feel    You sit there  youre sick of dealing with everything  and you desperately want to climb out of the funk but you know you cant  Its an indescribable feeling  the DESPERATE desire to do SOMETHING combined with the complete inability to do ANYTHING  Were I not bald  I would have pulled my hair out during these times (and actually  I have found myself tearing out body hair   for the sensat) ,1
It has a lot of different    It can take the form of rage and irritability  It can   be almost a thought I should kill myself and it doesnt even feel   ness  It can be very cognitive/intellectual--  theres no hope  the world is an evil place ,1
 is tricky   it can trick you so that you dont even know you are You dont feel  necessarily  You feel empty  unloved and unlovable  worthless   or you can feel this intermittent rage and annoyance at virtually everything ,1
It definitely blots out joy  hope  the good things   If you dont think anything is good at all  you look forward to nothing  you feel empty  you want a drink or a smoke  etc  you might beand not know it ,1
I get tricked by  even when I dont know Im   Its weird  Im sure that it actually doesnt matter if I die tomorrow or the earth falls into the sun  Maybe that would be a good thing in the end  Yeah  right  Thats  but it doesnt feel   anything ,1
Its not   feeling down  Its an intense feeling--as intense as any youve ever felt--of profound and irredeemable ness and despair  Its emotal pain akin to grief or mourning  but its not focused on anything in particular the way those two emots are  Its   there  taking over your life and your will  Its an emotal pain so sweepingly intense that many often contemplate  to end the pain ,1
To be honest  I wasnt actually aware of my  until afterwords when I counselor had brought it to my attent  Im not sure about other peoples experiences  but mine was a subtle transit  I never   saw myself sinking as low as I had ,1
While I did feel   nothing gave me gratificat  I kept trying and trying to derive joy from things  In this case  food  Nothing tasted good  and It drove me nuts eating burgers  spaghetti  tacos  pizza  etc  All in efforts to find something that seemed to hit the spot  Before I knew it  I ate so much I was about to explode and I yet I still wasnt satisfied  I gained a massive amount of weight  I before my slump  I was weighing around 170  At the end of my   I was about 215 ,1
I slept more than any human should  If I was home  I was sleeping  10 minute before work That seemed   a good time to sleep  I felt so exhausted and so worn out that sleep  while always unsatisfying  seemed to be the most viable opt  Work was a   thing too  I dreaded work more than I ever had  Getting out of  was the worst feeling of my life  and stepping into the doors of that place was   being punched in the stomach  I didnt feel   moving  I didnt feel   dealing with people  and I sure as hell didnt feel   making people happy ,1
On the subject of people  I lost a lot of friends that year  Every comment  and word  was a spiteful statement that came from some dark place in me  I didnt want to go anywhere or do anything with anyone  I wanted to stay at home  trapped in my room  sleeping  I remember a specific time when one of my friends actually told me how awful I sound to people and how I am never happy with anything  She said shed rather be alone and not deal with people if that meant dealing with people   me ,1
I let my hair run super long and ragged (VERY un  me)  I stopped caring whether my clothes were clean  my room was clean  or if even I was clean  I   did the bare minimums and only the minimums ,1
Looking back  there isnt a single picture of me smiling  All that was there was this blank  forced smirk I gave to make people happy enough to stop taking pictures  I hated pictures ,1
I was never aware I was in a   Looking back  all I remember thinking was   how much my life sucked  and how much I wanted to   get out of there and live in a place where I had no worries  responsibilities  or people  A black  inescapable hole is a good descript I would say  You   feel so alone  and so annoyed  angry    And sometimes it was my own acts that made it this way  not others ,1
It     you walk around all day with a lead blanket draped over you    those aprons you wear when you get an xray ,1
You sleep in until 10/11 every morning  then spend the day waiting to go to  at   9  but you cant fall asleep until 2 30  The part of the day that is spent out of  is usually spent   sitting around  you cant even get the motivat to play video games or play guitar  you mostly spend 5 hours a day pressing refresh on reddit  You never feel hungry so you never eat  Talking to people becomes a chore  You lose track of days  you think something happened a week ago and it was only yesterday  You stop talking to your friends  you actually stop talking to anybody  You stop going out  Most of the time you dont even feel any emot  its   bleak for 90% of the time  and when there is emot it is   the worst thing ever  much of the time you do actually feel   dying  It takes you 15 minutes to write a comment on Reddit ,1
There are multiple subtypes of   and different people will have different symptoms  Add to that that  very frequently co-occurs with   and theres gonna be a ton of variat ,1
I have atypical  (which is ironically the most common subtype)  which involves a lot of fatigue  crying  tendency to overeat  and sensitivity to reject  When Im not on medicat the main symptoms for me are fatigue  leaden paralysis (feeling of heaviness in the limbs)  inability to concentrate  and lack of motivat  I also have mild  issues  so Ill have occasal  spells to break the monotony of sitting   a bump on a log ,1
  for me  is a near complete lack of sensory input  Sunlight doesnt register  Scent is dulled  Tactile pleasures (   etc ) have no impact  There is no pleasure in life  and the strongest emots I can feel are anger and resentment  and even those are muted  There is no drive to do or accomplish anything  and I see life as if I were walking through a fog ,1
I had about 10 straight months of untreated  that   ended recently  The first thing I noticed - and was shocked by - was that the world in clear daylight is   stunningly beautiful and clear  I had not seen sunlight in nearly a year because of the fog of  ,1
My dad experienced  for a while  I never   understood what he was going through because I was too young at the time  Recently we were on a lengthy car ride together and it was brought up  he told me that my family went to a museum which was multiple stories and had an opening in the middle with railings around it  He said he consciously had to stay away from the railings because he wasnt sure he wouldnt jump ,1
Eating candy that tastes   dust ,1
  that nightmare where you try to scream but nothing comes out ,1
Its   riding a rollercoaster  feeling more and more bored as the track winds down  Apathy increasing every looping  twist and turn until you dont even care that you see the final drop around the next corner ,1
Metaphors without meaning ,1
feeling   you dont know the point  In anything,1
It     T S  Eliot ,1
Everything is a chore  Eating is a chore  Bathing is a chore    is a chore  Walking to the mailbox is a chore  Talking to anyone  even a cashier at the grocer  is a chore  Its all   so hard to do  Go to sleep (if possible)  wake up and its the same all over again ,1
Imagine that as your life ,1
The so-called  psychoticallyperson who tries to kill herself doesnt do so out of quote  hopelessness or any abstract convict that lifes assets and debits do not square  And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing  The person in whom its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise  Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows  Their terror of falling from a great height is still   as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window   checking out the view i e  the fear of falling remains a constant  The variable here is the other terror  the fires flames  when the flames get close enough  falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors  Its not desiring the fall its terror of the flames  And yet nobody down on the sidewalk  looking up and yelling  Dont  and  Hang on   can understand the jump  Not    Youd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to   understand a terror way beyond falling ,1
You   dont enjoy anything ,1
It     ,1
It is debilitating  You know you can do these normal everyday things  things you do ALL the time  but for some reason you   cant  Everything is overwhelming  Nothing makes you happy  You cant take care of yourself  let alone the things that matter to you most in life  be it people  pets or inanimate objects ,1
Its a beautiful day outside and you know you should get out and enjoy  but you cannot get yourself off the couch  or   for that matter  You feel awful  but cannot explain it  There is no reason for you to feel this way  yet you do ,1
I hope you are not actually in this state and if you are I hope you find help fast  Good luck ,1
I dont believe people  Even if they try to be sincere  I   understand their talk to be pure hogwash  If someone says its going to get better and it makes me get better  its not the believe that it is going to get better but that the persons concern must be founded on some hope and their hope gives me hope although I know it wont get better  Theres a pattern that you get used to and   time on bones  the cartilage becomes thinner and you cant take the pattern any longer ,1
Things dont lose meaning  nor do curiosities become nihilistic  but I stop questing the relevance of such things  Not because theyre not important but because the past and the future seem insignificant  I start living in the present and Im hit with the realizat that all my impact on this world is all in my head  Although people say that Im important  I dont believe them  Mainly because the impact I want them to have are not the impacts they show of having ,1
I become lessonce I realize that my  changes the people around me  That although I cannot measure my value directly  I can see the value I have when my usual self stops existing  Its a pattern that a lot of people fall victim to but I think I have  to a degree  taken control of it ,1
I am an extremely removed person  When an event happens  I become self-reflective and contemplate about the good and the      this morning I said something   the  sucks or something   that  I realized that if I limit my vocabulary  then I cant distinguish events since my world-view becomes either  not sucking or  sucking  Soon  everything becomes black and white  And I inevitably fall into  ,1
I try to avoid ideologies  self-labels  and maintaining a consistent world-view  but it takes a toll on my personality  Im at time bipolar-esque  I dont   connect with a lot of people  I dont feel   an outsider  but I feel   my place in society is not   other peoples place in society  I identify with a lot of philosophers and thats what I want to be  Although it   awkward calling myself a philosopher  its what I think I am  I was alwaysbefore having this mindset  But now I feel   I have an identity  although its a very ambiguous one  Whats a philosopher It something that is defined by how one acts  Attached to reason and metaphysical pursuits (I could defend this view) ,1
Its vain and self-centered because philosophers dont   change the world as medical doctors  engineers  or more practical professs do  but I   it and dont think Im  ing anyone (Im ready to go at it with any utilitarian if s/he disagrees) ,1
I wasthrough my late twenties  Received help from a great therapist  who descri it perfectly   is anger pointed at yourself  which after years and years breaks you down to nothingness  Turned out I was angry at so many people  so many things  but it always got turned back on myself    Im weak  I suck  I should have known better  why am I not cool instead of  you for picking on me   you for making fun of me   you for not being there for me   which released me from the darkness  needless to say  Ive come to terms with my anger and feel much better these days ,1
I always saw my  as   drowning in a huge lake  The falling is the worst  Feeling yourself sink below the surface into the deep and the dark  The agony as your body fights to breathe    the weight of the water above you pushing you down  The despair at ever getting back to the surface  No one ever tells you how much   s  Then  somehow  once you have reached the bottom  once all is lost  there is a sort of peace  You can feel nothing  see nothing  reach out to nothing  It doesnt   any more only because you are  essentially dead  Its   silent and still and hopeless ,1
Thats when I used to cut myself  in the hope that the pain would shock me out of my borderline catatonia  Feeling something  anything  was worth it  I know a lot of people mock self harm  but for me it kept me alive  and it wasnt attent-seeking or emo-posing  but a desperate attempt to save myself  I stopped because I got sick of ending up in hospitals explaining to psychiatrists why I shouldnt be sected ,1
Things have got better since then  I sought help and worked out ways of living with my illness  It is by no means gone but I have learnt to recognise its presence in myself  And learnt to find things to live for  going from a teenager in a mental institut who was told they would never make it through their GCSEs to a postgrad student at a top university is something of which I need to be proud  because it reminds me I have worth and a future  Even when my brain says otherwise  And most of the time I can keep above water  it is a lot of work but I can (that said  most people dont even have to swim)  but I will always know how easy it is for me to fall ,1
TLDR  is an awful  crushing illness  but one you can learn to manage and to succeed regardless ,1
I cant   describe the feeling to someone who hasnt been I read the rest of the answers here  and I can totally understand them  But during the time I was clinically(1999-2001) getting nonpeople to understand was close to impossible ,1
The only physical symptoms Ive ever noticed was a slightly painful swelling feeling in the chest cavity/stomach area  Sometimes hit with waves of nausea ,1
Basically  I wish I could actually live a decent life (this is ill-defined in part due to what seems to be my failing mind  but I seem to see features of one in some of the people I know)  But I cant possibly bring myself to do whatever I might need to do to work toward such goals  Physically and mentally I   seem to have been failing forever  but most acutely in the last few years (with some very brief interludes of distract/borderline pleasure)  I still sort of dont want to die  and I dont   what it might do to other people in my life  but I   dont see anywhere else I can go  I wish I could   randomly fall asleep one night (being able to do   that would be nice) fairly soon and not wake up ,1
Id try to recount more of my own experience  but everything Ive experienced seems to have been said better here already  My mind doesnt work well enough even to articulate to myself the particular issues I have that are specific to my own life  What Ive managed to put together here is probably difficult enough to read already  not actually decent writing despite others claims that I can write [well] ,1
I thought I wasfor a long time  Turns out I was   a lazy procrastinator who realized what he was and started hating himself for it  Then I got which was hard to work though  For me the trick was to always hold on to the light at the end of the tunnel  no matter how dim it might seem ,1
I think Im still sorta working through it  but Im generally happy now  I had to find meaning and something to work for ,1
This post has created a   amazing thread  I wish I could upvote it more than once ,1
 is a fifty-pound iron ball stitched into your chest that keeps you from wanting or being able to move or to do anything  even something as simple as going to  so that you can find some form of obliv in sleep ,1
 is thinking that you dont exist  because every time you look in the mirror all you can see is a gaping emptiness staring back at you  There is nothing of worth there  no purpose there  nothing good inside you  and no point to anything  You dont matter to anyone or anything - not even yourself ,1
I think everyone experiences  differently  but because men are socialized to not show weakness (or ness)  for us I think it sometimes comes out as anger  At least it did with me  I ended up alienating many of my friends and eventually my wife  and after a divorce I finally sought help  got on antiants and started climbing my way back up ,1
Thats what it felt   to me  being so deep in a well that there was little point in trying to get out  It felt   life was so pointless that there was no good reason to continue  Total hopelessness  Of course  its all an illus  brought on mostly by a chemical imbalance in the brain  But if untreated  it can be fatal  Were very lucky to be living in a time when  can be successfully treated in the vast majority of cases  but its up to the individual to seek help  and when youre down in that well  there doesnt seem to be much motivat to do so  Thats why its so important for friends and relatives to be able to recognize the difference between a   mood  situatal  (losing a job  a GF  etc) and true clinical   which has no root cause except biology  and to aid the person in getting help  I ended up having to do that for myself  but it was the best thing I ever did ,1
The cruelest part of my  was that eventually I felt I wanted to feel terrible  I was frustrated at attempts to cheer me up  because I was uncomfortable with the attempts  I felt   a circus elephant  being dragged around and made to perform tricks to satisfy peoples desire to help me to cheer up ,1
Its subconscious  but you eventually become aware of it  due to the extreme introspect that  forces you into  You look at yourself so hard that you start to catalog your failings  and your perceived failings are of course leg  The very fact that you are aware that you arebut cant change your thought patterns - the fact that you cant   fix yourself or cheer up - makes you believe that you are broken and there is no way out ,1
Worse  anti-ants sometimes arent the answer - they dont work for everyone  and the odds of a specific anti-ant working for an individual person actually arent that great  You have to go through a couple usually to get one that makes everything seem brighter - and it usually takes weeks to feel an effect  Worse  knowing youre on an anti-ant  and you still feel   this truly makes you feel   things will never get better  Side-effects can include a deeper   strong thoughts of   erectile dysfunct    you get the picture ,1
When you are your feelings are facts to you - indisputable facts  If you feel worthless  then you truly believe that you are indisputably worthless  and no amount of cajoling  encouragement or taking you out to get your mind off it will help you the next day ,1
Its as if a pilot friend told you that they wanted to free you from gravity by taking you on a plane flight - and you hate flying  You humour them  because you dont want to   their feelings - you dont want to tell them you resent that they enjoy flight  or that they fly whenever they want to  You get on the plane  and although youre enjoying the sensat of beating gravity  you still dont   flying  and you know the flight has to end  You begin to look forward to the flight being over  because the flight is outside your comfort zone  When you land  you recall your anticipat of it being over  and realise you hated every second  Your resentment of the pilot friend grows  and you distance yourself from them ,1
Yes  its self-destructive  but dont make the mistake of thinking that aperson is only acting irratally  Personally  everything I did seemed completely ratal - even my episodes of self-harm were driven by a ratal need to externalise some of my pain  Self-harm was distinct from  in my head  as the goals were completely different - I never worked myself up to a good solid attempt at my life (had a few demonstrative ones to illustrate that I wasnt   unhappy to a few wits who didnt believe in )  but if I had truly tried  I would have succeeded  Imagine the full power and calculated intent of a high-IQ genius (turned down a few Mensa invites in my time) bent towards ending their own life - there is nothing that would have stopped me  Scarily  that was actually a comforting thought - that I had the requisite intellectual power to find or invent a fail-deadly  painless mechanism of  ,1
With all this said  in the end  things got rather suddenly better for me (I was very lucky)  During one of my periods of quiet calm  after years of  and loneliness in the crowd  a girl asked me out  That simple moment  combined with the uncondital love  support  and companship that followed it  changed my life and opened the curtains on a new day for me ,1
She is now my wife  and years later  I still think about that period in my life with the realisat that she very probably saved my life ,1
Thank you  my sweet  You will never read this  but I promise to love you until the Sun is a dark husk  spinning in solitude in the darkness of a dead universe ,1
At its worse   gives me this hopeless feeling that can be so   that you physically ache  usually in the abdomen and chest  Its practically impossible to be happy and talking yourself through it is immensely difficult  You might be able to temporarily talk yourself out of it  but it only lasts for a minute at most  It debilitates you to the point where you cant do anything constructive all day and when you realize you havent done anything all day it makes you more,1
You want to tell someone about it  but every time you think youve built up enough say something  you hold back because you can feel yourself starting to break down  So in order to keep your composure you refrain and the cycle continues  and you never get to say anything to anyone so you   sit there dejected all day ,1
How I combat it is usually sleeping it off till the next day when it has usually passed  A more immediate solut is to cry it out in the shower or somewhere private but that doesnt last as long as it will come back later (although it lasts longer than trying to talk yourself out of it)  A more long term solut was to hit the gym regularly  Ever since I started going to the gym  Ive had much less bouts of   Exercise gives you something constructive to do so it takes your mind off whatever stresses you enough to put you into   It also works your body and makes you feel better about yourself since youre trying to improve yourself  It boosts your self-confidence which will in turn boost your mood in general  Exercise can even help with  thats due to chemical imbalances  I know my  is partly clinical  but getting exercise has helped me take it down to a tolerable level  (For the record  this is not medical advice so dont forgo a doctors visit on what I said) ,1
When you are normal  going to the grocery store is simple  you   do it ,1
When you are going to the grocery store is a complex  multi-step process and you cant begin to see how you might work up the energy to accomplish it ,1
 is a istic butler always lurking behind me  and whispering in my ear the reasons why my life is a waste  my friends will betray me  and that I will die alone ,1
  there is no point to anything  Happiness and positive feelings arent even within reach  Staying on task with anything is difficult because the mind cant focus ,1
Therapy helps  Finding someone who can help you figure out where the disconnect is  It could be between what you are doing and what you want to do or who you are and who you want to be or who you were and how to get back to it  Also helps with how to figure out what is truly important to you  what makes you happy  and how to get back on the path to feeling better ,1
  nothing    empty and null  Theres no real way to describe it    besides saying theres a lack of feeling altogether ,1
I will say that Ive never felt anything   it before my breakdown ,1
I   felt  all the time and didnt care much about anything anymore  I didnt see what the point to life was  I mean we live  we do  and then we die ,1
So anyways  my solut was   realizing that hey  life is pointless  so   have a good ride while it lasts ,1
It makes deciss difficult  You do everything slower  An overall sense of ness ,1
Id almost compare it to drowning  In a sea of ness  You get brief relief when your head is above water  Youve been drowning for so long(remember  everything is slower/seems longer) you dont remember what it     to not be drowning  You arent sure if you can save yourself and you   cant because what energy you have left is being used to keep you afloat  The deeper you go(in  and in the sea)  the higher the chances you will need help to stop drowning(meds/doc and lifeguard/floaty thing)  And the youve been drowning  the more apathetic you are to everything else ,1
I dont know  that is what deep      ,1
It     emptiness    you are a shell of yourself  You cant relate to anyone around you  and you   wish the earth would open and swallow you up right there ,1
Use these steps to get you through every day ,1
It gets better ,1
Empty and hopeless  You want to be gone  Away from everything  including yourself ,1
It     there are voices in your head and every time you hear something negative or think something negative the voices whisper  Killyourselfkillyourselfmakethepainggoawaykillyourself,1
Its hell ,1
The term itself reveals the fundamental foundat of the state ,1
To be impressed means that something made an impress on you  You are affected by something  Imagine pressing a dent into the side of an empty soda can    that is an impress ,1
To bemeans   the opposite  no impress has been made  You are not affected by something (or anything)  If we go back to the empty soda can analogy  imagine that dent popping back out  The surface is smooth ,1
When were nothing manages to affect us  At least  not positively  Ultimately  though  in my experiences    nothing effects you  You are an empty shell that nothing can dent ,1
Hope that helps ,1
Im bipolar  I get mostly agitated   but sometimes   good ol fashed  too ,1
Agitated ,1
You have all this insane energy  but you dont feel   doing anything  so you   pace back and forth  or mumble to yourself and your racing thoughts  or (in my case) purposely punch a brick wall until your hand breaks ,1
Your mind   keeps going and going and going in loops and circles and you cant take it anymore ,1
You feel   youre a waste  and   youre wasting your time  but nothing   worth doing  Everything sickens you  Youre pissed off at everyone  Incredibly irritable  The world is full of bastards but the worse part is you know that     youre the biggest piece of  of them all ,1
Its not ness  its not pain  its not anything  Its this complete vacuum inside you that nothing can fill  You try alcohol  drugs  TV  After a while  you dont even see the point of self-destruct  You   wish you could lie on the floor and wait to die ,1
You go about your day   a zombie  There comes a point when its almost comfortable  in a hellish sort of way  Youve been this way for so long that you cant remember  or imagine  why you would have bothered caring about anything before when all you want to do is waste away ,1
Boswell detailed Samuel Johnsons condit nicely - in my worst ive periods I can barely understand a simple sentence or detect melody in song  its an opaque brain fog ,1
I have  with insomnia  Have since I was five or six years old  in fact  I was so sleep deprived that I would sometimes halucinate  at least since I was in the first grade  I had no reason to think this wasnt normal so I didnt make an issue of it  My family merely seemed to think I was a peculiar sort--a bit   Wednesday Addams without the violence ,1
Life is a crushing weight  Have you ever had a job that made you so miserable you wanted to quit Thats what life      I would try to strangle myself with belts or ropes when I was ten  I didnt do this because I was teased or bullied  Nor was I seeking attent  I would hide and never told anyone ,1
I had a shrink describe halucinats for me once  He said that normally  you become aware of something through your senses  such as  you hear a sound with your ear which triggers a response in your brain that says train  But during a halucinat  your brain triggers train so you think your ear heard one ,1
Thats how my  manifests itself  I was in my mid twenties or so before I figured it out  My brain would be triggering angry so  I would think that a coworker had done something to make me angry  My brain would trigger   so I would think that my husband had done something that made me   There must be a reason I was feeling   right So  frequently I would pick fights with someone to  ify what I was feeling ,1
When I figured that out  I began to learn how to observe my feelings in a more detatched way  I can at least make an effort not to involve innocent people ,1
Life is still a drudgery  Its hard to get up and go to work every day  but I do because I must  I see TV shows about people who lay in their s  never getting up  until they weigh several hundred pounds and are no longer able to get up  I can totally picture myself in their shoes if I had an enabler  Every effort is so exhausting ,1
  you dont give a  about anything  They call it   but   I   feel numb  I live on a day to day basis   plans   goals  No motivat to pursue anything  I could win the lottery and feel ecstatic about it for only a few minutes before reverting back to the blahness  after that its   pretending and putting on a normal happy facade of what I want people to think I am ,1
I wouldnt say Im suicidal  Ive never tried to act on any suicidal thoughts  But who knows what tomorrow has in store  I   to sleep  I   to getup  The only time I ever get to enjoy myself is when it is induced artificially ,1
Theres no reason for this  No problem for me to fix and make it all better  I hate that I cant talk to anybody about this out of fear theyll think Im   being a whiny emo bitch  I feel ostracized from everyone else    theyre normal and Im the guy who overthinks things until they have lost all meaning and purpose ,1
I   took some xanax  Now Im going over to some friends to get shiaced and smoke weed  Theyre   chilling and having fun  Im escaping  This is the highlight of my entire week  Ive being stuck in this same rut for almost 4 years  I have a 9-5 job on the weekdays   jobs ,1
Pretty sure that last complaint is universal though ,1
Ive been suffering from  for about a year now  and even posting a comment in this thread is a good example  It   totally pointless  I was thinking at first of writing why Imand how Ive felt this year  but then Im reminded that everyone else has already hit the nail on the head and no ones   going to care what I have to say at this point  Id do anything to be invisible  because at least then I could sleep all I want without having to see the disappointed faces of the few people that do care about me ,1
There was a comment that I read here that said that its usually the weight of a few   experiences  topped off with one significant experience that finally breaks the camels back  I think in my case thats dead on  as Ive always been kinda walked over my whole life but I didnt care because I believed that good things happened to good people and I   enjoyed   helping people out and being positive  Ive been overweight my whole life and was picked on all the time  Ive had a couple of  s but I was young and stupid and they werent that serious  but then four years ago I met this amazing girl that I   did love  probably for the first time in my life  She was going through a tough time for a couple of years and I was there for her the whole time  Then  near the end of the relatship when things were finally going better for her and worse for me  she decided that because she was finally happy she didnt want me bringing her down  So she dumped me for an old crush  told me to grow up and forgot that I even existed within two weeks  We broke up at the end of last year and Ive received one e-mail since then asking me to troubleshoot a gaming console that Id sent her about a month after the breakup  pathetic I know  but it was the last promise Id made that I wanted to keep ,1
Its taken me a year to swallow that and even though Im starting to be able to think about her without feeling   Ive   been shot  Im nowhere near the guy that I used to be  You sleep all the time  you want to be left alone so damn  ly but at the same time part of you is screaming out for a hug  You look to anything else for comfort  be it food or video games  then realize how pathetic you are and go back to   You can funct around people  go to school  go to work  but when you get home you want to   go to  and get the rest of the day over with  Some days youll look in the mirror after mustering up the willpower to shower and dress nicely and theres a slight glimmer of hope  But then you go back to your regular daily routine  go to  that night alone and sigh when you think about mustering up that willpower again tomorrow ,1
Thats   me at least  Even reading it  it sounds a little extreme  as after over a year of feeling that way day in and day out Im trying to cut the people and habits that are keeping me down out of my life and its helping a little bit  But   I said  Im still not the guy that I used to be and Im not sure if I ever will be again  I        want to be happy  Thats all I want  and I know that it can happen     ugh ,1
To be concise  its the feeling of waking up  only to want to go back to   Every day  If its acute  it lasts for months  sometimes years  You go about life   enough to keep yourself alive  in the hope that something will come around to change it all  For me  that eventually happened  and a girl asked me out  I was incredibly happy  and we had a long-term  serious relatship  It was the only time in my life I can remember being truly happy  She recently broke it off to see someone else  and the emotal void of being bored  without motivat  and the intense social  is back  I feel   the solut is to find another relatship  but I dont know if I can get over my ex  nor do I know if I can find someone I can   respect in the same way  It doesnt help that the only happy thoughts I can think of are of her  knowing that shes completely out of reach  Most of my friends drifted away when we were together  so I dont even have them to reach out to   is being in this situat  and being completely blind as to how to fix it and become happy again ,1
I wrote this a while back when I was going through some   I was sort of   writing off the top of my head and venting to my computer but it turned out to express a lot about how I was feeling at the time  Anyways  thought Id share  irritat  anger  rage  blackout  consciousness  hatred  seething  boiling  pathetic  mocked  patronized  resentment  pathetic  your pain is not new  not original  not meaningful  meaningless  your struggle  of little importance  your feelings  your knowledge  your wisdom  your findings  trash  theres nothing new under the sun  and what you do is unoriginal  trite  cliche  laughed at  it has all been done before  and better  much better  the standards have been set  and you leave something to be desired  all is for nothing  ever fleeting hopes  dreams of escaping suffocat only to awaken and realize that you died in your sleep  now redirect your attent  look inward  dive deep  hide  abandon all desires and yearnings  hide  the water is much colder now  no sunlight can warm these depths  hidden  deep  dark  peace  shadows draw closer  there is company in these depths  watchful eyes  waiting to consume  waiting for your struggle to subside  let the cold envelope you  now sleep ,1
This thread is the most thing I have ever read ,1
The dead-eyed anhedonia is but a remora on the ventral flank of the true predator  the Great White Shark of pain [   ] Kate Gompert down in the trenches with the thing itself  knows it simply as It  It is a level pf psychic pain wholly incompatible with human life as we know it  It is a sense of radical and thoroughgoing evil not   as a feature but as the essence pf conscious existence  It is a sense of poisoning that pervades the self as the selfs most elementary levels  It is a nausea of the cells and soul  It is an unnumb intuit in which the world is fully rich and animate and un-map-  and also thoroughly painful and malignant and antagonistic to the self  whichself It billows on and coagulates around and wraps in Its black folds and absorbs into Itself  so that an almost mystical unity is achieved with a world every constituent of which means painful harm to the self  Its emotal character  the feeling Gompert describes It as  is probably mostly indescribable except as a sort of double bind in which any/all of the alternatives we associate human agency - sitting or standing  doing or resting  speaking or keeping silent  living or dying  - are not   unpleasant but literally horrible ,1
It is also lonely on a level that cannot be conveyed  There is no way Kate Gompert could ever even begin to make someone else understand what clinical       not even another person who is herself clinically because a person in such a state is incapable of empathy with any other living thing  The anhedonic Inability To Identify is also an integral part of It  If a person in physical pain has a hard time attending to anything except that pain  a clinicallyperson cannot even perceive any other person or thing as independent of the universal pain that is digesting her cell by cell  Everything is part of the problem  and there is no solut  It is a hell for one ,1
Well there was the tiredness  You never have any energy  no matter how much you sleep or rest  It     you are constantly in a weight suit and your body is too heavy  Literally everything is an immense effort and struggle to stay motivated   to complete simple tasks   feeding yourself  You also lose interest in pretty much everything  Even things you know you love will   seem frivolous and not worth the effort  Partly because of the tiredness and mostly because you   lose interest ,1
The interesting thing about  that I noticed is that you arent necessarily  all the time    incredibly more sensitive to everything  Anything can set you off and throw you into a terrible mood  Simply finding out that the food you were wanting to eat at home had run out can ruin your day completely ,1
Everything turns grey essentially  Food is bland  Colors are boring and dull  Sound and music is either boring or irritating on new levels  Touch is faint and unremarkable  Smells are almost entirely uninteresting  Jokes arent funny  but at best mildy amusing for fleeting moments  Movies are pointless  you dont get vested with characters  you dont   care about the ending  and youre probably watching it   so you arent trapped in your own head for another hour  Happiness is completely gone ,1
The only thing you look forward to is the quiet relief of sleep   ,1
Its horrible  The only way to understand it is to experience it  If someone you know ever says they might betake them seriously for s sake  Its a crushing and debilitating condit and is impossibly difficult to deal with  Dont tell them to suck it up  dont tell them they are overreacting  Help them ,1
A lot of times it       you dont feel   you   belong anywhere  and when youre alone it   seems to be worse  You feel   nothing you do has a purpose  you think that dying wouldnt make a difference in the world  The most dangerous thing is to be alone with your thoughts for too often  then you   feel   youre completely alone    having someone to talk to about your problems always seems to help  and if you dont feel   theres anyone to talk to  you have this entire community to pick you back up on your feet ,1
Ive had moments where I feel   I could   curl up on the ground and wish everything would   go away  Its not easy to live with  but face it  you are still alive today for a reason  All of us are  We are all alive because we hope someday well find love and happiness   wont get us anywhere  its   holding us back from achieving that dream  Go out and live  find something that makes you happy again ,1
I suffer from atypical   Im nearly 30 now  but have had this since I was a child  It got worse in my teenage years  and when I left to go to university I hit my worst time  which conversely pushed me to a point where I sought help  Sometimes you have to hit rock bottom before you make a change ,1
I live with my  Sometimes its better  others its worse  Right now  not so great  but certainly not as   as it used to be  Im   about functal right now  What I notice the most about it is how incapacitating it is  When Im in a particularly   period I cant think  I cant talk  I sometimes cant even focus on things  people or the world around me ,1
 is a veil hanging between you and the world  It colours the way you see everything  the way you behave and how you think the rest of the world sees you  For me  I have incredibly low self-esteem  which is intimately linked to my malady  I am a compulsive binge-eater and have a terrible body image  Everything  absolutely everything in my life relates to my self image and lack of confidence in how I look  both physically and mentally ,1
I suffer from hyper-sensitivity to reject  meaning that I find it very hard to interact with my friends and find it almost impossible to form relatships  In regards to my friends  I thankfully have some amazing friends who accept these parts of me  but even so I know that if they never see or hear from me they are going to get on with their lives irrespective of that  and if you dont remind people that you exist then you stop being part of their routine ,1
As I said I find relatships almost impossible  Im nearly 30 and have only  d 1 person for a short time  It was very intense and ended quite  ly with me  ing her  I simply couldnt believe that she  d me and kept on finding reasons to reject her  eventually breaking her heart  That was 2 years ago  and since then Ive had a disastrous friendship with someone I was in love with  but thats it ,1
Sorry Ive gone off on a tangent  Honestly  is a double edged sword  It attacks you within  twisting up your insides  and then warps the world around you as it destroys any normal relatship you have with the world  I know that I see the world in an incredibly distorted way  it permeates everything and prevents me from having a normal life  but its   not something I can simply shake off  its wrapped around the core of my very being   twisted  dark poisonous roots  Slowly unpicking my ness has taken years  although I have progressed ,1
Let me talk a bit about the   period  I can only   talk about  by talking about how its affected my life  so forgive me if this is long winded  its something   a stream of consciousness ,1
Id left home to come to university  I think this is where I finally went a bit mad  since up until then Id lived at home and my mum had helped me keep it together  My dad had   died a year or so previously  I had a lot of issues with him  needless to say the splash damage was massive  and is still a big factor in my life today ,1
Anyhow  at uni I basically went a bit wrong  I started with the best of intents  but as with everything else in my life  I lost interest quickly and stopped attending classes  I stayed at home  ate  hid from my friends and played wow  It got to the point where Id sleep all day  get up  go to the shops to buy ty food and then play wow all night  finally going to  around 6-7am when it was getting light ,1
Needless to say  I failed my second year of uni  I tried to repeat it  but once Ive made of a hash of something I find it incredibly difficult to sort it out  as I end up feeling too ashamed to do anything ,1
Throughout all of this my mum was being incredibly supportive  and I often lied to her about how I was doing  Lying is a   big part of   Not only do you lie to others  but you lie to yourself and try to obfuscate the real reasons for your behaviour  even if it means  ing others ,1
Everything came to a head at Christmas when I went to visit my family  I think by that time Id eaten so much that I was at my heaviest ever  pushing 300lb+  Im a big guy ay 6ft 3  but even so that amount of weight is hard to ignore  To my mum my weight is a symptom of my state of mind  and when she saw me get off the train  she actually couldnt look at me because it upset her so much  This in turn made me feel ashamed ,1
So  we had Christmas  I remember very little of it  except the sensat of mental exhaust  At that point I was at my lowest  I felt completely detached from the world  spiritually exhausted and absolutely leaden  When you feel that    you become so unhappy that you go numb  your vis starts to go dark and you become insensate to the world around you ,1
While visiting with my family I had a panic attack in a shop  Id never had one before  it was very unpleasant  It     a heart attack  you cant breath  After this happened  I had to sit down with my mum and talk about what we were going to do ,1
Eventually she got me to agree to a) see a therapist and b) talk to a doctor about medicat  I did both and gave medicat a go  and they both made a massive difference to me ,1
Now  people are very anti-medicat  and so was I  but I came to realise that my objects were based in a fear of what it would do to me  This is a ridiculous kind of bull  because Im arguing that its going to mess with my head  when my head is already a disaster zone ,1
I think of the two  therapy was more significant  but the combinat of the two helped massively ,1
The   period was about 4-5 years ago  Lots has changed since then  some things have stayed the same ,1
I still have a lot of the same problems I did then  but I am more able to cope with them now  I think the single most important thing when dealing with   or dealing with life fullstop  is making conscious choices ,1
Let me explain  So many of the deciss we make are made unconsciously  If you have a generally positive outlook this will probably work to your advantage  because you will usually base your deciss on positive outcomes  however if you suffer from  you may unconsciously make choices that exacerbate your condit ,1
Looking back at all the choices Ive made in my life I can see the way that Ive chosen and how it was intended to cause myself pain  It sounds absurd to say it out loud  but I actually made a lot of deciss – at least subconsciously – based on choosing an outcome that would cause the most amount of damage and pain to myself  I can still say that unfortunately I am more comfortable being in pain than I am being happy ,1
This is where conscious choice comes into play  I have started practicing making conscious deciss where I think about the outcomes and try to identify the positive ones so I can take the right route  Its not easy  because when you live in a constant state of fear of normality and happiness  its very easy to become subsumed in that  however Im old enough to be able to see that the best parts of my life have come from choices I made out of something other than   fear and self-flagellat ,1
TLDR  is a mind altering and crippling sensat that colours your experience of the world  It affects every facet of your life and runs   a poison through every decis and choice you make ,1
The sensat of  is   that of every limb being weighted down  even your mind  You feel   the only escape is sleep  and when that doesnt suffice you can imagine going as far as making that terrible ultimate choice to take your own life ,1
Ultimately  the way to deal with  is to step back into consciousness  as painful as that may be  You need to make conscious choices  including the desire to want something different and better  Speak to your doctor  get referred to a therapist  Dont forget if you see a therapist and dont   them  it might   be that therapist  try another one  Consider medicat  it has too much stigma attached to it  irrespective of how over-prescri it is ,1
Time slows down and there seems to be nothing enjoyable  You only think about the things and if a smile somehow comes across your face its almost  as you know that you wont be getting one again for quite some time ,1
From the moment I wake up it   as though my heart is pumping out negative emots  It literally     every heart beat carries the ness through my body  Its   my hearts actually aching ,1
Im afraid to go outside  I rarely eat  Im afraid of everything ,1
All the mistakes Ive made circles around my head   a broken record  all the time  From the moment I wake up I feel guilty ,1
I want to cry but Im afraid what will happen if I do  Im afraid of talking to my friends now as it is complicated and I fear I may overreact as I have done in the past  It     Im holding in emot  Numbness    ,1
I look in the mirror and under my eyes gets   purple  Everything I look at reminds me of something traumatic or a stupid mistake I did ,1
Theres too much confus  theres no relief    I dont know how else to explain it  Its to go to sleep  Its not relief for me ,1
Days of not moving   ,1
so ranting here   ,1
I have withdrawals coming up soon  from medicat  Its going to be harder than what I experience now  Its not liberat  Its the fear of liberat  The fear of being free  The fear of being with people because the fear of fear fear fear fear ,1
Im probably try to write a coherent post later on ,1
Sometimes its paired with   Youre worried at first that you might not fit in  that you might make a mistake and get ridiculed for it  or that youre not as attractive as everyone else ,1
Slowly  you start to avoid situats where you might be judged  You dont go to parties  You dont raise your hand in class  You try not to wear flashy clothes so you stand out less ,1
Then  to be on the safe side  you start to avoid things that are even tangentially related to the  triggers  You skip class  You stop talking to some friends  You avoid going to crowded places ,1
Thats about when the    sets in    many people have said here  you feel empty  In trying to remove any of the  from your life  youve also removed many of the spots for fun  You feel weighted down by all the worry you have  Youre always tired  because youre always on the defensive  You start to feel hopeless  because you feel   a wave of  will hit you no matter what you do  though on some level you know that part of this  is because you let it take over  which   adds a layer of guilt and feeling powerless to your own pressures  You always have a small headache  Sleeping is the best part of your day  and everything is bland  because that was your s strategy all along ,1
Null  It     nothing  No happiness  no complete ness    no emotal connect with anything  Nothing is fun  Nothing is painful  except the root of your   which will bring you to your knees in a hearelt anguish in an instant ,1
  when you have to get up early the next morning  but you cant sleep  so you toss and turn all night and sleep for three hours  When you finally get up  and force yourself out of  and force yourself to get ready when you     want to go back to   Thats what       All of the time ,1
Its        theres a lead weight in your chest at all times  As though simple tasks    getting out of  or putting on your shoes or facing the day are monumental tasks that seem impossible to achieve    everything is a total disappointment  and you dont even want to bother doing anything because you   know its going to end up in failure  Its laying in   staring at the ceiling  because thats better than facing anything the day might thrust at you  Its bleak  and its cold  and its horrible  and I dont wish it on anyone ,1
You know that thing that makes you  say  brush your teeth Take a shower Eat breakfast Those things you do because you care what happens to you  You care that your teeth wont rot  You care that youll be healthy  The shorthand I use for that is  hope   takes that away ,1
With   nothing is worthwhile  You know it is  intellectually  but you dont feel the impulse to do it the way normal people do  Its basically impossible to spontaneously care about anything ,1
How did I get around it I took Remeron for about six months  That put me in touch with what it     to be  normal  Then  I began to say yes to opportunities  because it seemed to matter what happened next  And  what happened next was good ,1
Once you have some practice being  normal you establish productive habits and thinking patterns  Relapse is somewhat inevitable  but you become practiced and handling and recovering from it ,1
I was in a   relatship that made my little bit of  become full-blown and forced me to be hospitalized  I felt that nothing that I did   mattered  and that maybe one or two people actually cared about me  After that time  I remembered an old Jewish folktale that   spoke to me ,1
Those were words that used to be my motto  and I had forgotten them when I needed them the most  So  I had a ring made with these words that Ive been wearing for years  When things look   and my  hits me  I look at my ring and am reminded that the   times wont always be around  Its been a lifesaver ,1
Ive been in and out of astate for nearly a year  It has rob me of virtually all ambit  and I now quest the path I have chosen in life   has never felt   an opt  but during one particularly   day  I felt I understood how someone could take their own life if those feelings had lasted for a few days  I find the best thing is to be busy  but its only a temporary solut  If Im left alone with my thoughts  the feelings of  eventually come back  My current living situat only makes things worse  but I wont get into that ,1
Pretty much all my life Ive had terrible self-esteem  and when combined with  and  about deciss and situats most people would consider trivial  the effects can be profound (and not in a good way)  To give an example  if someone gets a better mark in school than I  I feel   because I tell myself I should be able to do better (regardless of what mark I got)  Conversely  if I get a better mark than someone else  I feel   for them and think to myself Whats the matter with you I did better than you  I put myself in a posit where I cannot win  and as  as it is to say  Ive gotten somewhat used to it ,1
Ive beena lot late in high school  Heres my experience ,1
In summary  Youre a convicted felon  Youre either locked up  in prison  or on parole  And your sentence isnt going to end in any foreseeable time frame ,1
